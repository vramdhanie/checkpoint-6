## Instructions

Download this repository of code and open it in Visual Studio Code.

Start your Live Server and open the file _index.html_ in the browser using Live Server.

Alternatively you may just open the _index.html_ file in your browser without Live Server.

Open the file _index.js_ in your Visual Studio Code editor and write the solutions to the drills. As fast as you write the solutions you will see the tests passing on the HTML file in the browser.
